# RiskRegisterLab

Lab Scenario:
In this lab I conducted a risk analysis layout structure to determine the potential risk for certain mains of a financial banking company that needed to meet government regulations to avoid legal arbitration conflict. The details shown below of its environment expose the potential issues the company may have to fix before it can be exploited by criminal means for government authority to audit against the business. The sections of the vulnerabilities I labeled show the rate of likelihood, severity and priority of the situational manners. This shows the complete overview of what I had to analyze. 

Operational environment:
The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank's dataâ€”100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank includes 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are marketed by a professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. There are strict financial regulations that require the bank to secure their data and funds, like having enough cash available each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements.
